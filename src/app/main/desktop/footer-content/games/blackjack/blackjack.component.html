            <h2 class="sc-NUcrz jrxmYg">✪ Blackjack Game Rules</h2>


            <p>
                The main aim of blackjack is to get to the numerical 21 or as close to it as they can in value of the
                cards. The number cards are all evaluated at their face value. While all the character cards are worth
                10. Keep in mind that Ace could either mean 1 or 11.

            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless of what variation of blackjack that you might play, it’s crucial to keep a few of the rules
                in mind.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Always divide your 8’s & Aces - aces hold a value of 11, so the players have a greater
                        possibility of getting a strong hand if they divide them. Two 8’s have a collective value of 16,
                        which is recognised as a weak total in blackjack. Drawing any card valued high or at 6 will
                        result in a bust, so dividing them is the only way to go.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Consider carefully before doubling down - the move might seem enticing, but it’ll restrict your
                        flexibility. Evade it if your hand sums around 18 or 19, if the dealer’s card is 11, 10 or 9 or
                        if you are on a limited budget.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Insuring guarantees no losses - this side bet can safeguard you from losing your beginning wage
                        if you forecast the dealer’s down card correctly. Even so, it's a highly risky choice in the
                        long term, as the odds that the dealer’s down card has a value of 10 are normally less than 2:1.
                        Additionally, you’ll confront a greater house edge.

                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                Let’s take into consideration the results of different blackjack hands when you bet Rs.100. While also
                taking into consideration blackjack winnings of 2:1 as contrasting to the frequent 3:2 for ease of
                comprehension:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        When you have a 16 that is a king and 6 and the dealer has a 10 that is a king and an unknown
                        card and your following card is a 4 which gives you the sum of 20. If the dealer’s unknown card
                        is a 7 then you’ve won Rs.200!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>

                        When you have 2 Aces, it’s a 12 or 2 and you would desire to divide it which will double your
                        probabilities of succeeding. So now you will get an additional card on each of these bets. If
                        you get a 10 on one hand, which makes it a 21 and you get 7 on the other and the house gets 18,
                        that is a king card and an 8. You win the initial hand which will give you Rs.200 and the second
                        one is a push so you neither lose or win. So you get to keep the Rs.100.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>

                        Now let’s consider you get a 6 and a 5 which makes it a 11 and the dealer has a Queen and an
                        unknown card. You would be smart to double down with a bet that doesn’t surpass your beginning
                        bet of Rs.100. Let’s say you bet Rs.100 itself and one of your cards is a jack. This makes it 21
                        and your sum is now Rs.400.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Now keep in mind that while the above instances all landed draws or wins that doesn’t mean that you have
                to always double or split. Remember to select smartly and bet marginally.
