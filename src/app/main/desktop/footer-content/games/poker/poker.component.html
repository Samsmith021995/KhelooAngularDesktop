            <h2 class="sc-NUcrz jrxmYg">Types of Online Poker</h2>


            <p>
                There are different kinds of real money poker games that you can play to win real cash. Following are
                the top 5 choices:

            </p>

           <h3> 1. &nbsp;Texas Hold’em Poker</h3>
            <p>
                Texas Hold’em is the most famous poker variant found in nearly all live poker real cash applications. In
                Texas Hold’em Poker, the dealer offers you with 2 face-down cards and 5 community cards given out in a
                series of 4 betting rounds. The bettors have to utilise both the community and hold cards to create the
                finest 5 card hand merger to win.

            </p>

           <h3> 2. &nbsp;Pot Limit Omaha Poker</h3>
            <p>

                Omaha is similar to Texas Hold’em; although, the players will get 4 hold cards instead of just 2 and 5
                community cards. Like Texas Hold’em, the betting procedure takes place in 4 rounds. In Omaha poker,
                bettors have to assemble the finest 5 cards using 2 hole cards and 3 community cards.
            </p>

          <h3>
          3.&nbsp;Five Card PLO and Six Card PLO

          </h3> 
            <p>

                Five card and 6 card PLO, as their names imply, are played with 5 and 6 hold cards respectively. The aim
                stays the same, make the best 5 card hand. Although, due to the inclusion of additional hold cards, the
                probability of making high standing mergers increases substantially. Thus, these 2 variations produce
                more action and develop greater pots.
            </p>

            <h3>4.&nbsp;Seven Card & Five Card Stud Poker</h3>
            <p>

                Both of these online games of poker are very similar to one another. In seven card stud poker or razz
                poker, you are offered 4 face-down and 3 face-up cards and the players have to assemble the finest 5
                cards out of these 7. And in five card stud poker, you are offered 5 cards, out of which you can
                exchange 3 cards to make the greatest standing 5 card poker hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 5 card draw and stud poker, initial hand choices are important. You are required to be very choosy
                about the hands you select to play, as you are not able to view all of your competitors’ cards. Both
                these variations include restricted data on one’s competitors and need more selective initial gand play
                and provide less bluffing.
