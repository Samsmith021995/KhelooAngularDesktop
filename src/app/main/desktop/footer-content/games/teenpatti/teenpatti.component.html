            <p>

                In a live Teen game, players have to place their bets, following which the dealer deals the cards. Once
                the player is done betting, the dealer begins dealing with the player’s cards. A sum of three cards are
                accessible in the game. The player’s cards can be viewed as placed on the screen. Once you are familiar
                with your card, the following step is to select if you want to play or fold. If you decide to play, you
                have to make another bet which will be twice the primary amount of the bet. In the end, the dealer will
                expose his cards and the player with greater cards will be declared as the winner.

            <h2 class="sc-NUcrz jrxmYg">✪ Teen Patti Game Rules</h2>

            <p>
                Real cash Teen Patti game online rules are not much tougher to learn than its gameplay. The Teen needs
                all the players to make bets before or after they have accepted their 3 cards. Although, these 2 bets
                are not the same. This game’s rules also specify that every player requires a bet that suits the
                previous bet in the game (the present stake), even if it's greater than their primary wager. For
                instance, if a player’s Ante was 2 units and a former player made a 4 unit extra bet, their following
                extra bet has to be 4 units.

            </p>
