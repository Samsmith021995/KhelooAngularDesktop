            <h2 class="sc-NUcrz jrxmYg">History of Football</h2>

            <p>
                The history of football dates back centuries ago to the worlds of ancient Greece, Aztecs, China and
                Aboriginal Australians. Although, it wasn’t until 12th-century England that a game that mimics today’s
                version came to be. The initial organized rules of football were first brought back in 1863 with the
                formation of the primary Football Association in England.

            </p>
            <p>
                A few of the earliest clubs were Notts County in 1862 and Sheffield in the former is one of the oldest
                professional clubs to exist and is still going strong till date. The first competition in football
                history is the cherished FA Cup, held for the very first time in 1871. It wasn’t long before the
                Football League was developed with 12 teams. Soon many more teams joined in on the competition.

            </p>
            <p>
                Another major milestone was the emergence of FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association),
                an international football association that still administrates the game. Under its assistance, the
                initial FIFA World Cup took place in Uruguay in 1930. The World Cup is the largest competition when it
                comes to national teams. That said, the largely popular football club competition is the UEFA Champions
                League (formerly known as the European Cup) among the major European clubs.

            </p>
            <h2 class="sc-NUcrz jrxmYg">Is Football Betting Sites Legal in India?</h2>
            <p>

                While football betting is majorly illegal in India, it is crucial to keep in mind that there is no law
                that would actually make a majority of football betting sites illegal. So, if you are questioning if
                online football betting is legal in India, then it seems that this legal crack means you can enjoy
                football betting online without panicking about legal problems.
            </p>
            <p>

                This is because many of the world’s finest bookies have realized this technicality and also know that
                numerous Indian sports lovers will be thinking if online football betting in India is legal or not. As
                an outcome, the fact that multiple of these football betting sites are established in offshore locations
                signifies they can provide Indian residents the chance to legally bet on sports without worrying the
                wrath of the authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to this, betting on football online has become an actual phenomenon in India over the past years.
                While there are laws such as the 2000’s Information Technology Act that bans the use of any web
                technology to bribe citizens, it seems that the use of offshore football betting websites is greatly
                ignored by legislators.
