            <p>
                Tennis is increasingly competitive than ever before, especially in men’s play. Some of the older players
                are staying on the top, but it looks like the youngsters are certainly gaining ground.

            </p>
            <p>
                This makes offering a foolproof tennis forecast in 2023 a somewhat tricky task. When it comes to the
                Grand Slams, names such as Nadal and Djokovic will forever be among the cherished to triumph. However,
                Zverev, Medvedev and Carlos Alcaraz should definitely not be turned a blind eye on.

            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, the younger players have seen more success in Masters tournaments than in the Grand Slams. We also
                need to take into consideration the fact that Nadal and Djokovic are pursuing each other’s records in
                terms of leading titles, so they’re not going to give up their leading positions just yet.

            </p>
            <p>
                On the WTA Tour, things are even more uncertain. The youngster Iga Swiatek looks to be a promising
                rising star and is having an excellent couple of years. No other player in the tennis world seems to be
                as consistent as Iga currently.

            </p>
            <p>
                Emma Raducanu and Naomi Osaka are sort of on a downward slope, which means that basically any 2 girls
                can make the finals. Where there’s uncertainty, there’s an opportunity for you to benefit. Just check
                out our WTA, outright odds and see if you can forecast a successor of a major and place a winning tennis
                bet.

            <h2 class="sc-NUcrz jrxmYg">History of Tennis</h2>

            <p>
                The history of tennis is quite long and filled with thrilling details. It is believed that the game we
                today call tennis emerged in Northern France during the 12th century when the players struck the ball
                with the palm of their hand rather than a racket. A few called it jeu de paume which translates to game
                of the palm in english.
            </p>
            <p>

                People started utilizing rackets somewhere during the 16th century, and the game came to be known as
                tennis, which emerged from the French tenez, meaning hold.
            </p>

            <p>
                The origination of the newest game dates back to the middle of the 19th century. People credited for
                launching modern tennis are 2 sportsmen called Augurio Pereira and Harry Gem. in 1874, British army
                officer Walter Clopton Wingfield altered the game and substantially donated to its fame. This was also
                when the very first tennis tournament occurred in Birmingham.

            </p>
            <p>

                Few years later in 1877, the Croquet Club and All England Lawn Tennis held the very first Championship
                at Wimbledon. Simultaneously, the game of tennis went across the Atlantic and reached the US, where in
                1880 the first American National Championship occurred.
            </p>
            <p>

                A year later, the first US Open was held in Rhode Island, Newport. The Australian Open and French Open
                originated in 1905 and 1891, respectively. The first Davis Cup, which only included a battle among Great
                Britain and the United States, started in 1900 and was subsequently expanded to include other nations.
            </p>
            <p>

                Tennis was part of the initial Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, but it was taken out from the programme
                in 1924. The sport made a comeback to the Games in Seoul in 1988.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a major part of tennis history, this was an amateur sport. Professionals existed, but they were not
                permitted to battle in leading tournaments. This changed up in 1968 when Grand Slams consented to host
                pros, marking the start of the Open Era.
