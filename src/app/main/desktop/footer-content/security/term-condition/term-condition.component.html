        <h2 class="sc-NUcrz jrxmYg center">VII. Skill based game PROCEDURES</h2>
        <p>
            A. Placing Bets/Wagers

        </p>
        <p>
            It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure details of their bets/wagers are correct. Once
            bets/wagers have been placed they may not be cancelled by the customer. Bets can only be changed by the
            customer using our Edit Bet feature, where this is available. Kheloo reserves the right to cancel any
            bet/wager at any time.

        </p>
        <p>
            Your funds will be allocated to bets/wagers in the order they are placed and will not be available for
            any other use. Kheloo reserves the right to void and/or reverse any transactions made after a bet/wager
            has been placed involving allocated funds, either at the time or retrospectively.

        </p>
        <p>
            B. Bet/Wager Confirmation

        </p>
        <p>
            Bets/wagers will not be valid if there are insufficient funds in your account. In case of telephone
            bets/wagers 'acceptance confirmed' will be deemed only after an operator has completed a full read back
            of the bet/wager details and confirmed to the customer that the bet/wager has been successfully
            processed and accepted.

        </p>
        <p>
            A bet/wager that you request will only be valid once accepted by Kheloo’s servers. Each valid bet/wager
            will receive a unique transaction code. We shall not be liable for the settlement of any bets/wagers
            which are not issued with a unique transaction code. If you are unsure about the validity of a
            bet/wager, please check your account history, or Contact Us.

        </p>
        <p>
            Notwithstanding the above, if bets/wagers are placed via a credit or debit card they are not valid until
            we have received payment in full. The bet/wager will be automatically void if we have not received the
            payment prior to the relevant event commencing.

        </p>
        <p>
            Should a dispute arise, you and Kheloo agree that the Kheloo transaction log database will be the
            ultimate authority in such matters.

        </p>
        <p>
            C. Offers

        </p>
        <p>
            Where any term of an offer or promotion is breached or there is any evidence of a series of bets placed
            by a customer or group of customers, which due to enhanced payments, Free Bets, risk free bets, Bet
            Credits or any other promotional offer results in guaranteed customer profits irrespective of the
            outcome, whether individually or as part of a group, Kheloo may reclaim the enhanced payment, Free Bet,
            risk free bet or Bet Credit element of such offers and/or void any bet funded by the Free Bet or Bet
            Credits. In addition, where there is evidence of such activity, Kheloo may levy an administration charge
            on the customer up to the value of the Bet Credits, Free Bet, risk free bet or enhanced payment towards
            the administrative costs incurred in identifying and taking action against the activity.

        </p>
        <p>

            Kheloo may reclaim any bonus amount, Free Bets, Bet Credits or enhanced payments that have been awarded
            in error. All customer offers are limited to one per person. If Kheloo has reasonable grounds to suspect
            that a bonus or offer is being claimed by or for the benefit of the same person more than once or by a
            group of people then it may withdraw the availability of any offer or all offers to that customer or
            group of customers and/or void any bet funded by the bonus or offer and remove any winnings from such
            bet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kheloo may, at any time, make minor amendments to the terms and conditions of any offer or promotion to
            correct typographical errors or to improve on clarity or customer experience and may cancel any offer or
            promotion for legal or regulatory reasons. Kheloo reserves the right to amend the terms of or cancel any
            customer offer or promotion at any time.

        </p>
        <p>
            D. Settlement And Payouts

        </p>
        <p>
            1. All bets and wagers are subject to the Skill based game Coverage provisions (including maximum
            winnings) set out in Appendix Two to these Terms and Conditions.

        </p>
        <p>
            2. Kheloo reserves the right to suspend a market and/or cancel any bet/wager anytime. When a market is
            suspended any bets entered will be rejected. Kheloo also reserves the right to cease Skill based game on
            any markets at any time without notice. Should a customer include a non-runner or void selection in a
            multiple bet/parlay, the bet will be settled on the remaining selections. This includes selections that
            have been made void where ‘Void if player does not start’ is selected at bet placement.

        </p>
        <p>
            3. Winnings from settled bets/wagers are added to the balance of your Skill based game account. Any
            funds/winnings credited to an account in error are not available for use, and Kheloo reserves the right
            to void any transactions involving such funds and/or withdraw the relevant amount from your account
            and/or reverse the transaction, either at the time or retrospectively.

        </p>
        <p>
            4. Kheloo reserves the right to withhold payment and to declare bets on an event void if we have
            evidence that the following has occurred: (i) the integrity of the event has been called into question;
            (ii) the price(s) or pool has been manipulated; or (iii) match rigging has taken place. Evidence of the
            above may be based on the size, volume or pattern of bets placed with Kheloo across any or all of our
            Skill based game channels. A decision given by the relevant governing body of the sport in question (if
            any) will be conclusive. If any customer owes any money to Kheloo for any reason, we have the right to
            take that into account before making any payments to that customer.

        </p>
        <p>

            5. Where there is evidence of a series of bets each containing the same selection(s) having been placed
            by or for the same individual or syndicate of individuals, Kheloo reserves the right to make bets void
            or withhold payment of returns pending the outcome of any subsequent investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. For events where there is no official 'off' declared, the advertised start time of the event will be
            deemed the 'off'. If for any reason a bet is inadvertently accepted after an event or match has
            commenced (other than live In-Play Skill based game clearly indicated on the Website), bets will stand
            providing the final outcome is not known, and that no participant/team has gained any material advantage
            (e.g., a score, sending off for the other team, etc.) at the time the bet was placed. If the outcome of
            an event/market is known Kheloo reserves the right to void the bet, win or lose. Disputes over times
            bets are placed will be settled using the transaction log. All times stated on the Website and/or
            referred to by Kheloo staff relate to Sri Lanka Standard Time (SLST) unless stated otherwise.

        </p>
        <p>
            7. In-Play Skill based game - where we have reason to believe that a bet is placed after the outcome of
            an event is known, or after the selected participant or team has gained a material advantage (e.g., a
            score, sending off for the other team etc.) we reserve the right to void the bet, win or lose. If for
            any reason we are unable to validate the outcome of a particular market (e.g., due to loss of live
            pictures), all bets will be void, unless settlement of bets is already determined.

        </p>
        <p>
            8. Where a customer gives ambiguous instructions, Kheloo reserves the right to split the number of
            monies staked between the potential outcomes. Where this is impractical, we reserve the right to void
            the whole of that bet. In any event, the decision of Kheloo is final.
